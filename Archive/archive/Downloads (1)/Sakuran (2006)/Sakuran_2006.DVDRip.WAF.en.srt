1
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:52,396
Step right up!

2
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:07,245
Kiyoha!

3
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:17,324
A client!

4
00:02:38,653 --> 00:02:40,143
Come on in...

5
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:44,154
Come on in...

6
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:57,805
Kiyoha, do you know
who that was?

7
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:03,875
Takao's man.
Some kind of tormented artist.

8
00:03:04,012 --> 00:03:09,678
So that's who's taking her money!
No wonder the old lady's so pissed off.

9
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:11,217
Kiyoha!

10
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:12,411
What?

11
00:03:12,554 --> 00:03:15,045
Shut up and behave.

12
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,024
You're far too picky
about clients, you are.

13
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,862
'Her heartless lover...

14
00:03:27,702 --> 00:03:30,432
'...is now outside the Quarter,
in Mukojima.

15
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,532
'Alone, without a client,
she tilts at windmills.'

16
00:03:53,228 --> 00:03:55,287
Get cute with me, will you?

17
00:04:00,836 --> 00:04:04,567
You piss me off, you pig!

18
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:06,606
Let go!

19
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:08,139
Hands off!

20
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:10,836
Let go, I said!

21
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:13,971
Get your hands off me!

22
00:04:36,838 --> 00:04:40,069
Just what is it
that bothers you, anyway?

23
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:44,776
This world is a vale of tears.

24
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:50,177
There's nothing in it
that doesn't bother me.

25
00:04:52,187 --> 00:04:55,418
Is there anything
you like about it, Seiji?

26
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,121
Well? ls there?

27
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:08,969
Save that for the clients.

28
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:55,209
Ah, I love a good pipe.

29
00:05:56,451 --> 00:06:01,286
You can smoke on your back
and the ashes don't fall on you.

30
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:21,039
<i>SAKURAN</i>

31
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:30,145
<i>The cherry trees
were so beautiful...</i>

32
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:33,583
<i>...I forgot I'd been sold.</i>

33
00:06:34,155 --> 00:06:35,645
Hurry it up!

34
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,384
Shut up and look at
the cherry trees.

35
00:06:38,526 --> 00:06:40,585
What did you say?!

36
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:43,189
Hey!

37
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:44,326
Come back here!

38
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:45,626
Get lost!

39
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:46,324
Shut up!

40
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:47,264
Come here!

41
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:32,677
Bubbles! Bubbles!

42
00:07:33,181 --> 00:07:36,446
All colors of the rainbow!

43
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:39,144
<i>Hey! It's the Tamagikuya oiran!</i>

44
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:40,537
I shouldn't...you always pay
more than the going rate.

45
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:44,383
I just give you
what the boss tells me to.

46
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:47,247
Here.

47
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:49,322
No, Miss Hamayu.

48
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:53,788
'Hamayu of the Tamagikuya'
died 20 years ago.

49
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,131
Tell the boss O-Ran said hello.

50
00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:12,938
So you're the new girl?

51
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:22,817
Not bad at all!

52
00:09:23,124 --> 00:09:26,753
You're pretty enough to train
for a courtesan.

53
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,324
Now, listen...

54
00:10:08,403 --> 00:10:11,895
You belong to the Tamagikuya now.

55
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,068
You'll serve Elder Sister Shohi,
and she'll teach you lots of things.

56
00:10:27,222 --> 00:10:31,454
Your name will be 'Kiyoha'.

57
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:33,555
'Kiyoha'?

58
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:36,362
It sounds like a plant!

59
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:38,192
I don't like it.

60
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,366
Ow!

61
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:50,368
I do not wish a filthy little
boiled root for an attendant.

62
00:10:56,784 --> 00:10:59,378
Oh! She stinks!

63
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:02,615
My nose is about to fall off!

64
00:11:08,263 --> 00:11:10,857
So that hick came back again?

65
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:14,127
Yes! I can't take him any more!

66
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:16,294
You look worn out!

67
00:11:16,437 --> 00:11:21,875
He wanted it five times!
One after another!

68
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,673
Get him so drunk he passes out.

69
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,713
You're awful!

70
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:30,179
You'll burn in hell!

71
00:12:03,084 --> 00:12:06,645
<i>Women, women, women.
A worId of women.</i>

72
00:12:06,788 --> 00:12:12,556
<i>The thought I'd become one of them
suddenly terrified me.</i>

73
00:12:13,895 --> 00:12:17,126
Hey, you little brat!
Watch where you're going!

74
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,926
Hey!

75
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:25,100
Come here!

76
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:27,537
Damn you! Let go!

77
00:12:27,675 --> 00:12:29,199
Let me go!

78
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:30,673
Let go!

79
00:12:30,812 --> 00:12:33,212
You can't leave here!

80
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:37,981
Even if you manage to get out,
it's no different outside.

81
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,844
Come on.

82
00:12:42,023 --> 00:12:44,253
Cherry blossoms...

83
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:55,826
Why aren't there any in here?
There's lots outside the wall.

84
00:13:08,016 --> 00:13:09,711
This is a cherry tree.

85
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:15,918
The day it flowers,
I'll take you out of here.

86
00:13:16,057 --> 00:13:19,515
No, thanks. I'll take myself out.

87
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,733
You've been sold
to the Tamagikuya.

88
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,040
I'll teach you what happens
when you run away.

89
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:46,685
You can never get out of here.

90
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,385
I'll get out.

91
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,553
When the cherry tree flowers
at Inari Shrine, l'll be gone!

92
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:02,392
That tree doesn't flower.

93
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:05,333
It never will.

94
00:14:05,473 --> 00:14:10,911
Get used to being here
in the Quarter.

95
00:14:36,938 --> 00:14:37,962
No!

96
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:41,039
I can't stand it!

97
00:15:03,397 --> 00:15:05,058
Shohi!

98
00:15:23,084 --> 00:15:24,779
Shohi!

99
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:00,613
Shohi!

100
00:16:02,323 --> 00:16:04,052
A goldfish...

101
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,763
Shohi!

102
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:25,577
<i>If l stay,
I'll turn into a horrible oiran!</i>

103
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:46,732
My goldfish...

104
00:16:47,969 --> 00:16:50,199
You killed one of them.

105
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:56,839
Inside the bowl
it would have been fine.

106
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,908
Put a goldfish in the river,
and what you get is a carp.

107
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:10,353
They only stay beautiful
in their bowl.

108
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,387
Why would you jump...

109
00:17:16,697 --> 00:17:18,597
...out of your bowl?

110
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,661
<i>I don't want to be an oiran!</i>

111
00:17:37,885 --> 00:17:41,719
<i>Most of the girls here
never become oiran!</i>

112
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:46,190
<i>Say that when you are one!</i>

113
00:17:49,497 --> 00:17:51,465
I don't want to be a whore!

114
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:56,397
And who's the girl
this whore's money feeds?!

115
00:18:02,877 --> 00:18:05,437
You're a contrary little bitch.

116
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:11,550
The clients won't want you around.

117
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:17,423
So where else can you go?

118
00:18:18,926 --> 00:18:23,886
Go clean out drains
or toilets, then.

119
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:26,928
Earn your keep that way.

120
00:18:32,673 --> 00:18:35,039
That'd suit you better.

121
00:18:35,276 --> 00:18:37,335
You? Become a whore?

122
00:18:38,546 --> 00:18:41,037
A stupid village girl like you?

123
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:43,676
You'll never make it.

124
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:48,179
<i>Let alone an oiran.</i>

125
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:53,052
Who are you calling stupid?
What do you know?!

126
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:56,686
<i>I'll learn to play samisen and koto.
And poetry!</i>

127
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:59,459
Then I'll become a 'new girl'.

128
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,966
Then a courtesan.

129
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:04,333
<i>And straight on to oiran!</i>

130
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:15,376
A whore can make a client
do what she wants him to.

131
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:22,321
For that you need
'the tricks of the trade'.

132
00:19:27,962 --> 00:19:32,661
lf you ever want out of here,
you must rise through the ranks...

133
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,667
...and find a rich merchant's son.

134
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,193
You have this.

135
00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:13,505
The more a girl is given things...

136
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:16,367
...the more the others hate her.

137
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:19,937
<i>That's being an oiran.</i>

138
00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:24,217
And no one likes you, so it's perfect.

139
00:20:28,155 --> 00:20:30,521
Wear it after your first time.

140
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:22,603
Good, firm flesh...

141
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:29,472
Good color, too.

142
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:38,281
Kiyoha...you really are
a goddess.

143
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:42,020
The kind you only see
once in ten years!

144
00:21:52,673 --> 00:21:55,233
It's time you were put forward.

145
00:21:55,476 --> 00:21:59,742
With that innocent way you have...

146
00:22:00,247 --> 00:22:04,206
...and that pussy,
you'll make 'em weep for joy.

147
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:12,118
Then I shout out, 'Yes, there!'
and, 'Oh, that feels so good!'

148
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:16,093
Then bend backwards
and pant real hard.

149
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,592
No.

150
00:22:21,335 --> 00:22:26,272
Kiyoha, you don't 'shout'.

151
00:22:27,975 --> 00:22:29,670
Your voice 'seeps' out.

152
00:23:06,046 --> 00:23:07,843
Mr Konoya's here.

153
00:23:14,188 --> 00:23:16,088
Send Kiyoha instead.

154
00:23:29,837 --> 00:23:31,532
Excuse me.

155
00:23:32,172 --> 00:23:34,197
Come in.

156
00:23:41,915 --> 00:23:44,509
Well! Who are you?

157
00:23:45,285 --> 00:23:47,913
<i>I wanted the oiran, not a new girl.</i>

158
00:23:49,757 --> 00:23:53,989
I'm here in her place.
My name is Kiyoha.

159
00:23:55,796 --> 00:24:01,701
Whatever kind of plant you are,
I'm not your typical old fart.

160
00:24:10,444 --> 00:24:15,848
Just being young isn't enough.
A girl's got to know something.

161
00:24:15,983 --> 00:24:20,443
The young ones make a lot of noise,
then they get sleepy and hungry.

162
00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:23,579
When they drink they get crazy.

163
00:24:24,892 --> 00:24:25,916
Back home they say...

164
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,929
Stop it. I don't need to hear
all about you.

165
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:37,926
They say a man who teases a girl
is just a big kid.

166
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:42,605
What?

167
00:24:44,411 --> 00:24:49,872
You don't like the young ones
because you love them so much.

168
00:24:56,657 --> 00:25:00,923
'I don't like the young ones...

169
00:25:01,195 --> 00:25:03,425
'...'cause I love 'em so much...'

170
00:25:03,564 --> 00:25:07,193
<i>You old bastard!
What did you tell the oiran?!</i>

171
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:10,329
Takao is very, very jealous,
you know.

172
00:25:10,471 --> 00:25:16,103
I told her how wonderful you were,
and how much I liked you.

173
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:21,309
It worked out better
than I ever thought!

174
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:24,309
Fuck off and die!

175
00:25:33,761 --> 00:25:37,629
Old Man Konoya for your first time!
You're so lucky!

176
00:25:38,532 --> 00:25:42,992
Mr Konoya's been coming here
since he was a young man.

177
00:25:43,137 --> 00:25:47,073
Nothing to worry about.
Just lay back and shut your eyes.

178
00:25:47,608 --> 00:25:50,042
I'm only worried that...

179
00:25:50,177 --> 00:25:53,578
...while my eyes are shut
he'll fall asleep.

180
00:25:56,316 --> 00:26:00,218
<i>Takao-oiran must like you,
though.</i>

181
00:26:00,354 --> 00:26:03,949
Letting you have
a regular client like that.

182
00:26:04,091 --> 00:26:05,752
I wonder...

183
00:26:05,893 --> 00:26:10,193
Mr Konoya seems to have been
very persistent.

184
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,855
So it's not her idea...

185
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,592
Watch out, Kiyoha.

186
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:15,861
Yeah!

187
00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:17,937
Uh-oh!

188
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:28,004
Kiyoha, since all you've got
going for you is your looks...

189
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:32,249
...I'll let you in on something.

190
00:26:32,953 --> 00:26:37,822
The old man likes them
meek and mild.

191
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:44,820
So just lay back and let him do
whatever he wants.

192
00:26:55,576 --> 00:26:57,669
Oh yeah?

193
00:27:22,536 --> 00:27:26,063
Ah, me!

194
00:27:26,607 --> 00:27:28,768
You smell so good...

195
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:31,537
Kiyoha, you're so nice...

196
00:27:32,246 --> 00:27:35,511
I am? You've said
nothing but bad things about me.

197
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:38,113
Don't be angry.

198
00:27:38,318 --> 00:27:40,309
I'm goingto show you...

199
00:27:41,088 --> 00:27:44,455
...just how nice you are.

200
00:29:27,027 --> 00:29:29,518
Kiyoha! Kiyoha!

201
00:29:31,898 --> 00:29:35,766
She drives me wild!
She's only 17!

202
00:29:36,036 --> 00:29:38,869
Look how white she is!

203
00:29:39,106 --> 00:29:42,872
<i>She's every bit as beautiful
as Takao-oiran.</i>

204
00:29:43,443 --> 00:29:46,503
<i>She'll be the next oiran.
Just you wait!</i>

205
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:50,449
I'll be her first!

206
00:29:50,584 --> 00:29:52,643
You're crazy! I will!

207
00:29:52,786 --> 00:29:53,309
It's me!

208
00:29:53,453 --> 00:29:53,942
Me!

209
00:29:54,087 --> 00:29:54,849
Me!

210
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:06,455
Me!

211
00:30:08,068 --> 00:30:09,330
It's you.

212
00:30:21,581 --> 00:30:24,982
All her clients come back
before three days are out!

213
00:30:25,185 --> 00:30:27,983
The girl's amazing!

214
00:30:28,121 --> 00:30:31,022
The daytime's busy, too.

215
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:36,461
Maybe we should give her
her own room.

216
00:30:36,596 --> 00:30:40,032
And triple her price.

217
00:30:46,873 --> 00:30:49,808
Like butter wouldn't melt
in her mouth!

218
00:30:49,943 --> 00:30:52,434
When did she learn
to make eyes like that?

219
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:54,444
Yeah! She's really good.

220
00:30:54,581 --> 00:30:56,776
It drives me crazy!

221
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:59,385
Why have I worked so hard
all these years?

222
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,783
Maybe you should take lessons!

223
00:31:01,922 --> 00:31:03,890
What a thing to say!

224
00:31:05,092 --> 00:31:10,029
<i>I can't explain why,
but I know exactly what to do.</i>

225
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:15,228
<i>How to tilt my head
and Look at them...</i>

226
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:19,932
<i>How to Linger on them,
how to move...</i>

227
00:31:21,241 --> 00:31:22,936
<i>Why, I don't know.</i>

228
00:31:43,897 --> 00:31:47,731
You're a man of wit, sir...

229
00:31:48,301 --> 00:31:49,632
I am?

230
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,636
Thanks.

231
00:31:58,478 --> 00:32:01,504
I'm not much good at this.

232
00:32:02,949 --> 00:32:04,780
Is it fun for you?

233
00:32:07,687 --> 00:32:08,915
Yes.

234
00:32:09,723 --> 00:32:11,748
Where are you from?

235
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:13,921
Up north.

236
00:32:15,495 --> 00:32:17,963
So you must like seeing the snow...

237
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:23,063
I've made up my mind
to forget everything...

238
00:32:23,737 --> 00:32:25,796
...from before I came here.

239
00:32:31,444 --> 00:32:33,309
You have?

240
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:40,484
Then when I come here
I'll forget everything, too.

241
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:17,720
The man of your dreams
will be handsomer than mine!

242
00:33:17,857 --> 00:33:19,347
Read my wish!

243
00:33:21,294 --> 00:33:23,091
It's for candy!

244
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:29,629
I wonder who he was...

245
00:33:46,386 --> 00:33:48,081
Excuse me...

246
00:34:01,434 --> 00:34:04,232
This place has so many rules!

247
00:34:04,704 --> 00:34:07,036
They're a nuisance.

248
00:34:10,777 --> 00:34:11,903
What's wrong?

249
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,577
Sit down.

250
00:34:31,531 --> 00:34:35,058
I left the other day
without telling you my name.

251
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:37,234
That bothered me.

252
00:34:38,204 --> 00:34:41,469
I didn't want you remembering me
as 'Joe Blow'.

253
00:34:45,245 --> 00:34:49,648
My name is Soujiro.
I came to tell you that.

254
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:57,888
'Sou...

255
00:34:58,358 --> 00:34:59,586
'...ji...

256
00:35:00,393 --> 00:35:01,621
'...ro'.

257
00:35:31,725 --> 00:35:33,920
I won't do anything...

258
00:35:35,795 --> 00:35:37,456
...to cause you trouble.

259
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,973
Sorry.

260
00:36:38,591 --> 00:36:41,583
<i>Oiran, Mitsunobu's here.</i>

261
00:36:45,765 --> 00:36:47,164
Shigeji...

262
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:50,158
...here.

263
00:36:58,978 --> 00:37:00,445
Mitsu!

264
00:37:09,689 --> 00:37:11,350
Kiyoha?

265
00:37:13,126 --> 00:37:17,358
You mean the girl
with the bold eyes?

266
00:37:17,664 --> 00:37:19,859
You liar!

267
00:37:22,669 --> 00:37:26,503
You said you only painted flowers...

268
00:37:27,173 --> 00:37:32,475
...because there were no women
you wanted to draw!

269
00:37:32,979 --> 00:37:35,243
I wasn't lying.

270
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:37,942
Why did it have to be her?

271
00:37:39,786 --> 00:37:42,277
She was watching me.

272
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,351
Those eyes...

273
00:37:46,726 --> 00:37:48,557
...sent chills up my spine.

274
00:37:54,934 --> 00:37:57,425
If it's her you love...

275
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:01,933
...then kill me now.

276
00:38:14,954 --> 00:38:17,616
Were these hands to kill me...

277
00:38:18,558 --> 00:38:20,788
...I would die happy.

278
00:38:23,129 --> 00:38:24,221
Ow!

279
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:28,527
Mitsu!

280
00:38:29,702 --> 00:38:34,696
You know how I feel!
Stop pretending you don't.

281
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:46,450
I have dozens of men...

282
00:38:51,558 --> 00:38:54,550
...but my heart belongs to you.

283
00:38:55,795 --> 00:38:58,320
Why won't you believe me?

284
00:39:12,845 --> 00:39:16,781
I hate it when morning comes.

285
00:39:22,488 --> 00:39:24,888
I feel the same.

286
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:31,727
Now I'm here with you...

287
00:39:32,899 --> 00:39:38,030
...but once I leave,
you're not mine any more.

288
00:39:40,206 --> 00:39:45,405
I hate to think of you
with another man tonight.

289
00:39:50,383 --> 00:39:53,216
Don't talk like that.

290
00:39:55,855 --> 00:40:00,758
The more a whore swears love...

291
00:40:02,662 --> 00:40:08,123
...the more she is accused
of deception.

292
00:40:12,905 --> 00:40:14,202
I guess so.

293
00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:18,939
It's worse for you, isn't it.

294
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:22,976
Forgive me.

295
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,885
I...

296
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:32,050
...trust you.

297
00:40:56,582 --> 00:41:02,214
Stop it! My nail clippings
are flying all over the place!

298
00:41:04,023 --> 00:41:06,787
What's wrong with Kiyoha?

299
00:41:06,926 --> 00:41:09,952
Has she done something?

300
00:41:10,096 --> 00:41:12,462
Her heart's not in it lately.

301
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:14,623
She's off in her own little world.

302
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:17,964
Maybe she shouldn't
be seeing so much...

303
00:41:18,471 --> 00:41:19,870
...of 'him'.

304
00:41:20,306 --> 00:41:26,006
I mortified to hear it, sir.
I'll speak to her.

305
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,808
Thank you.

306
00:41:27,947 --> 00:41:29,505
Thank you, sir!

307
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:33,716
What are you doing
to make a regular tell me that?

308
00:41:35,521 --> 00:41:38,388
You're seeing too much of that guy.

309
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:43,922
And you're brushing off
Lord Sakaguchi, another regular.

310
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:46,862
That ape!

311
00:41:47,433 --> 00:41:49,424
What about next time he comes?

312
00:41:50,403 --> 00:41:54,737
What about it? I don't like him.

313
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:57,233
Oh, I see!

314
00:41:57,777 --> 00:42:01,076
<i>Pretty high and mighty
for someone who isn't an oiran.</i>

315
00:42:01,614 --> 00:42:04,549
Well, if you won't meet
Lord Sakaguchi...

316
00:42:06,185 --> 00:42:09,882
...I'll just have to fix it
so you don't see Sou.

317
00:42:20,066 --> 00:42:21,465
Kiyoha?

318
00:42:24,437 --> 00:42:25,802
Are you all right?

319
00:42:26,572 --> 00:42:30,338
That bitch!
She's got me where it hurts!

320
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,579
I have to go
with Lord Sakaguchi.

321
00:42:34,413 --> 00:42:37,610
The last thing I want now!

322
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:42,444
But he's a great lord!

323
00:42:42,588 --> 00:42:46,183
He might even
buy you out of here.

324
00:42:46,325 --> 00:42:48,384
You'd never lack for money again.

325
00:42:48,828 --> 00:42:53,231
Just keep Sou on the string
and go on like you are.

326
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:56,634
With those 'tricks'
you're so good at.

327
00:42:59,405 --> 00:43:02,738
I've been learning those
since I was an attendant.

328
00:43:03,776 --> 00:43:06,336
I'm steeped in them to the bone.

329
00:43:08,481 --> 00:43:09,812
I'm sick of it.

330
00:43:11,017 --> 00:43:16,387
That's why I don't want to
deceive him with those tricks.

331
00:43:18,157 --> 00:43:19,647
Kiyoha?

332
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,391
Kiyoha!

333
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:37,174
She's in love, and he loves her.

334
00:43:38,311 --> 00:43:40,438
She won't deceive him.

335
00:43:42,682 --> 00:43:45,674
Must be nice!

336
00:43:52,091 --> 00:43:54,855
Milord Sakaguchi!

337
00:43:54,994 --> 00:43:56,757
Kiyoha's waiting, sir!

338
00:43:56,896 --> 00:43:57,692
She is?

339
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:00,993
She's played hard to get
so you'd want her all the more.

340
00:44:01,133 --> 00:44:02,498
lsn't that sweet!

341
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:05,433
Perfect for a gentleman like you, sir.

342
00:44:05,571 --> 00:44:06,799
Indeed?

343
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:09,100
This way, sir. Come upstairs.

344
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:20,680
Very nice!

345
00:44:40,339 --> 00:44:45,834
Well! Lord Sakaguchi!
Good evening!

346
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:47,502
Missus...

347
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:54,748
Kiyoha's very nice!

348
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:57,612
We'll go and prepare, then.

349
00:44:57,757 --> 00:44:59,725
All right. I'll see you soon.

350
00:44:59,926 --> 00:45:01,917
I'm on fire!

351
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:06,726
It'll be a long night!

352
00:45:13,272 --> 00:45:15,137
See you later.

353
00:45:20,479 --> 00:45:24,006
See? You can do it if you try!

354
00:45:24,383 --> 00:45:26,749
Just keep on like that.

355
00:45:28,087 --> 00:45:29,952
Go and get ready!

356
00:45:36,062 --> 00:45:37,427
Kiyoha...

357
00:45:38,631 --> 00:45:42,931
<i>Takao-oiran would like
to see you for a minute.</i>

358
00:46:00,553 --> 00:46:03,249
You won't deceive, you say?

359
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,050
<i>Oiran!</i>

360
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:08,286
That means...

361
00:46:09,261 --> 00:46:12,458
...you don't want to betray.

362
00:46:15,735 --> 00:46:19,000
You are two
who have pledged your troth.

363
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:22,564
Then prove this isn't a game...

364
00:46:24,777 --> 00:46:27,644
...and that you won't betray him.

365
00:46:28,814 --> 00:46:30,782
Show me.

366
00:46:56,275 --> 00:46:57,503
Kiyoha!

367
00:47:00,146 --> 00:47:01,545
I had to see you.

368
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:08,211
Soujiro...

369
00:47:15,194 --> 00:47:16,388
Boss!

370
00:47:21,801 --> 00:47:23,098
What?!

371
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:29,770
Well, find her before
Lord Sakaguchi notices!

372
00:47:32,578 --> 00:47:34,239
Damn her!

373
00:47:39,752 --> 00:47:41,083
She's not here!

374
00:47:41,387 --> 00:47:44,550
Where could she have gotten to?!

375
00:47:46,826 --> 00:47:48,953
Looking for Kiyoha?

376
00:47:54,533 --> 00:47:56,967
She's 'powdering her nose'.

377
00:48:03,242 --> 00:48:08,111
Here in the Quarter that means
she's off with a lover.

378
00:48:10,216 --> 00:48:12,047
I know that much.

379
00:48:13,419 --> 00:48:14,647
Where is she?

380
00:48:18,991 --> 00:48:20,288
Where?!

381
00:48:40,412 --> 00:48:41,743
Kiyoha!

382
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:43,880
Sou!

383
00:48:56,028 --> 00:48:59,054
Kiyoha! Where are you?!

384
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,458
Move! Kiyoha!

385
00:49:03,936 --> 00:49:05,301
Where are you?!

386
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:06,964
Kiyoha!

387
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,839
Where's Kiyoha?!

388
00:49:15,381 --> 00:49:18,043
Kiyoha!

389
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,051
What are you doing?

390
00:49:28,928 --> 00:49:30,395
'What'?

391
00:49:31,864 --> 00:49:33,729
What a stupid question.

392
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:42,333
Move!

393
00:49:42,474 --> 00:49:45,034
You're not making merry with him!

394
00:49:45,177 --> 00:49:47,805
You're making merry with me!

395
00:49:47,947 --> 00:49:48,914
Milord!

396
00:49:49,048 --> 00:49:50,640
Lord Sakaguchi!

397
00:49:50,783 --> 00:49:53,149
Get your hands off me!

398
00:49:53,285 --> 00:49:56,083
This is my night to howl!

399
00:50:24,883 --> 00:50:28,114
Are you out of your mind?!

400
00:50:28,354 --> 00:50:33,656
No matter how popular you are,
you're still only a whore!

401
00:50:33,926 --> 00:50:37,453
Remember that!

402
00:50:39,531 --> 00:50:41,328
Trollop!

403
00:50:51,977 --> 00:50:53,308
<i>Kiyoha!</i>

404
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:57,008
<i>I had to see you.</i>

405
00:50:59,985 --> 00:51:02,886
<i>The days of waiting for him...</i>

406
00:51:03,622 --> 00:51:05,112
<i>...will drive me mad.</i>

407
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:14,097
<i>I had to see you.</i>

408
00:51:20,906 --> 00:51:25,275
<i>But when I see him
I go madder still.</i>

409
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:32,583
More!

410
00:51:33,085 --> 00:51:34,848
More!

411
00:51:52,805 --> 00:51:54,170
Mitsu!

412
00:52:04,049 --> 00:52:06,813
No! Hold still!

413
00:52:22,201 --> 00:52:23,133
Mitsu!

414
00:52:23,402 --> 00:52:24,869
Mitsu!

415
00:52:48,427 --> 00:52:49,724
Yes...

416
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:55,994
It's the best way...

417
00:52:58,704 --> 00:53:00,695
I kill you...

418
00:53:07,212 --> 00:53:09,077
...and I die, too.

419
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:43,678
Time for the evening show.
You'd better get ready.

420
00:53:47,419 --> 00:53:51,753
Get ready for who?

421
00:53:53,926 --> 00:53:55,291
Well...

422
00:53:56,261 --> 00:54:00,357
That guy won't be coming,
but it'll be busy tonight.

423
00:54:09,374 --> 00:54:11,535
Busy, busy, busy...

424
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:30,054
<i>Lowest-ranked oiran in the Quarter!</i>

425
00:54:30,562 --> 00:54:33,087
Takao's past her prime.

426
00:54:33,398 --> 00:54:35,559
Her boyfriend's dumped her, too.

427
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:38,670
Kiyoha's still as popular as ever.

428
00:54:38,804 --> 00:54:41,773
That doesn't look good
for Elder Sister.

429
00:54:41,907 --> 00:54:43,204
While Kiyoha...

430
00:54:43,342 --> 00:54:46,243
She drops His Lordship,
and her man drops her!

431
00:54:47,221 --> 00:54:49,052
The clients love it!

432
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:51,055
Really!

433
00:55:03,104 --> 00:55:06,505
But that guy's
a real piece of work.

434
00:55:07,108 --> 00:55:10,600
Always pretending
he's new to the Quarter...

435
00:55:17,085 --> 00:55:20,350
Made to drink of the bitter cup
by the man she loves...

436
00:55:21,222 --> 00:55:24,714
My heart just bleeds for
the poor dear!

437
00:55:25,393 --> 00:55:30,353
Just watching it happen
sent the chills all through me!

438
00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:42,942
I'd appreciate your sympathy more
if you hadn't arranged it all.

439
00:55:50,084 --> 00:55:55,112
It's hell being in love.
It's hell being loved.

440
00:55:58,457 --> 00:56:01,585
And it's hell
being sexy to survive!

441
00:56:03,796 --> 00:56:05,696
You know nothing.

442
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:09,734
Why shouldn't I trust
a man I love?!

443
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:11,803
Kiyoha! Stop it!

444
00:56:14,807 --> 00:56:18,607
You've got a few clients
and now you're all grown up, huh?!

445
00:56:18,744 --> 00:56:20,371
Let go!

446
00:56:20,946 --> 00:56:25,781
Come down into hell with me
and you'll know how it feels!

447
00:56:26,218 --> 00:56:27,378
Let go!

448
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:28,850
Let go!

449
00:56:28,988 --> 00:56:30,080
Let me go!

450
00:56:30,222 --> 00:56:32,349
What do you know about it?!

451
00:56:32,491 --> 00:56:33,890
Stop it!

452
00:56:34,393 --> 00:56:35,985
Come back here!

453
00:56:45,404 --> 00:56:48,100
Cry and you lose. Love and you lose.

454
00:56:48,407 --> 00:56:49,840
Win and you lose.

455
00:57:16,535 --> 00:57:17,559
Hey!

456
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,168
Where are you going?

457
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,007
Just to the bath.

458
00:57:31,684 --> 00:57:33,379
Are you ready for this?

459
00:57:38,123 --> 00:57:40,353
It's eating away at me.

460
00:57:46,265 --> 00:57:51,362
'She who runs away will be known
by her dainty feet'...

461
00:58:07,586 --> 00:58:09,884
<i>How will he look at me?</i>

462
00:58:10,622 --> 00:58:11,782
<i>In tears?</i>

463
00:58:12,691 --> 00:58:16,457
<i>An evil leer?</i>

464
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:19,921
<i>When I see for myself...</i>

465
00:58:20,899 --> 00:58:22,924
<i>...will I know even then?</i>

466
00:58:36,482 --> 00:58:38,814
<i>Haberdashery & Sundries</i>

467
00:58:39,118 --> 00:58:40,517
Be right back.

468
00:59:21,627 --> 00:59:22,719
Oh...

469
00:59:24,763 --> 00:59:26,731
The smiling demon...

470
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:20,784
Don't waste your tears on him.

471
01:00:21,587 --> 01:00:23,782
Save them for your clients.

472
01:00:28,694 --> 01:00:30,286
Who's crying?!

473
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,631
Everywhere's the same.

474
01:00:46,578 --> 01:00:48,307
At least now...

475
01:00:50,782 --> 01:00:52,409
...I know that.

476
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:37,445
Out of the way!

477
01:02:44,863 --> 01:02:46,831
Gods preserve us!

478
01:02:47,232 --> 01:02:48,859
What a waste!

479
01:02:49,301 --> 01:02:50,461
Tsunezo!

480
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:53,235
Keep this quiet.

481
01:02:55,741 --> 01:02:57,834
Out of the way!

482
01:03:00,746 --> 01:03:02,907
Purify the room with salt!

483
01:03:03,282 --> 01:03:04,214
Yoshizo...

484
01:03:04,349 --> 01:03:05,509
Clean this up.

485
01:03:07,185 --> 01:03:08,812
What a sight!

486
01:03:09,321 --> 01:03:12,688
That damn artist took off!

487
01:03:13,225 --> 01:03:14,886
He did it!

488
01:03:15,427 --> 01:03:18,055
That bastard!

489
01:03:18,196 --> 01:03:20,994
After all her talk about love...

490
01:03:21,133 --> 01:03:23,294
...having its own rules!

491
01:03:24,036 --> 01:03:26,129
Rise to Buddha!

492
01:03:33,745 --> 01:03:34,712
So?

493
01:03:37,082 --> 01:03:41,314
We need a courtesan
fit for the highest grade...

494
01:03:41,453 --> 01:03:44,820
...to take her position.

495
01:03:47,025 --> 01:03:50,984
You're the only one who can do it,
Kiyoha.

496
01:03:51,129 --> 01:03:53,893
Just get someone almost as good.

497
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:55,994
We can't do that!

498
01:03:57,436 --> 01:04:01,998
I'm fine being number 2 or 3.
I'm freer to bitch that way.

499
01:04:02,941 --> 01:04:04,772
You're our only girl...

500
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:06,639
...fit to promenade!

501
01:04:06,778 --> 01:04:09,008
Seiji! Say something!

502
01:04:10,816 --> 01:04:11,840
<i>Oiran...</i>

503
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,421
<i>Please, Oiran.</i>

504
01:04:54,492 --> 01:04:57,757
Kiyoha! I heard you ran off.

505
01:04:58,262 --> 01:04:59,991
Where did they catch you?

506
01:05:03,334 --> 01:05:05,802
They didn't catch me.

507
01:05:07,138 --> 01:05:09,663
I came back myself.

508
01:07:17,335 --> 01:07:19,064
This way.

509
01:07:22,106 --> 01:07:27,134
The samurai's name is
Kuranosuke Matsumoto.

510
01:07:27,278 --> 01:07:29,872
He's a very important gentleman.

511
01:07:30,348 --> 01:07:34,785
He'll be a very good customer.
Don't let him get away!

512
01:07:36,454 --> 01:07:40,914
His power and money mean nothing.
If I like him, he won't get away.

513
01:07:41,058 --> 01:07:43,618
If not, I won't meet him again.

514
01:07:50,701 --> 01:07:55,434
I saw your promenade
the other night.

515
01:07:57,308 --> 01:07:58,935
Very beautiful.

516
01:08:01,011 --> 01:08:03,206
Thank you.

517
01:08:03,781 --> 01:08:06,306
I very much wanted to meet you.

518
01:08:07,685 --> 01:08:10,449
And I must say...

519
01:08:11,789 --> 01:08:14,986
...that paulownia chest-of-drawers
is very nice.

520
01:08:16,594 --> 01:08:21,531
The chest may look very nice,
but there's nothing inside it.

521
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:29,027
I thought it was a point of pride
with the ladies of the Quarter...

522
01:08:29,173 --> 01:08:31,835
...to hide that from a client.

523
01:08:32,643 --> 01:08:36,306
Pretending there's something there
when there isn't...

524
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:39,143
It's petty. I don't do that.

525
01:08:39,283 --> 01:08:42,946
Pretending there's nothing there
when there is something...

526
01:08:43,087 --> 01:08:44,782
That's called 'style'.

527
01:08:46,056 --> 01:08:47,421
I see.

528
01:08:49,093 --> 01:08:55,931
Perhaps this money will buy you
kimonos to fill that chest of drawers.

529
01:09:00,137 --> 01:09:04,164
I didn't say I wanted money
to fill that chest.

530
01:09:08,913 --> 01:09:10,608
We were meant to be.

531
01:09:10,915 --> 01:09:13,782
<i>An oiran has expenses.</i>

532
01:09:14,185 --> 01:09:15,880
Please don't be shy.

533
01:09:18,289 --> 01:09:21,349
However great a samurai
you might be...

534
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:24,526
...you don't please a courtesan
with money.

535
01:09:27,898 --> 01:09:30,230
So you can just bugger off!

536
01:09:51,155 --> 01:09:55,683
What do you think?
Not a bad dancer, eh?

537
01:10:01,332 --> 01:10:02,424
I yield.

538
01:10:02,566 --> 01:10:03,965
I win!

539
01:10:04,101 --> 01:10:05,762
How dare you!

540
01:10:06,537 --> 01:10:08,300
What are you doing?!

541
01:12:10,527 --> 01:12:13,428
I apologize, Milord.

542
01:12:13,564 --> 01:12:17,227
She's still getting ready.
I'll send her straight here.

543
01:12:17,368 --> 01:12:18,960
That's all right.

544
01:12:19,803 --> 01:12:22,601
I'm enjoying the sake.

545
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:33,377
<i>Should you keep him waiting,
Higurashi-oiran?</i>

546
01:12:33,517 --> 01:12:37,317
Sure! You were here first.

547
01:12:37,454 --> 01:12:38,978
Yeah, but...

548
01:12:39,256 --> 01:12:44,125
...I'm not a regular.
I work for days to afford you!

549
01:12:44,328 --> 01:12:48,924
You should be looking after
clients with money!

550
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:52,100
Me...

551
01:12:53,003 --> 01:12:56,131
...I'm crazy about you.

552
01:12:56,306 --> 01:12:59,298
I'm in heaven just being here.

553
01:12:59,877 --> 01:13:02,437
You're such an idiot!

554
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:06,208
That's exactly
what I like about you.

555
01:13:07,117 --> 01:13:12,111
And I know very well
that you don't have any money.

556
01:13:12,256 --> 01:13:13,917
Yeah, I guess so...

557
01:13:17,628 --> 01:13:19,255
Excuse me.

558
01:13:52,062 --> 01:13:55,930
Today I come only to apologize.

559
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:07,237
My behavior the other day
was unpardonable.

560
01:14:07,711 --> 01:14:12,011
Please find it in your heart
to forgive my poor manners.

561
01:14:17,688 --> 01:14:19,952
Raise your head, please.

562
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:24,790
It's as you say.

563
01:14:27,264 --> 01:14:30,165
A courtesan does have expenses.

564
01:14:31,135 --> 01:14:34,969
I was lying when I said
your money meant nothing.

565
01:14:40,144 --> 01:14:41,975
I apologize.

566
01:14:54,057 --> 01:14:55,422
Seiji...

567
01:14:58,829 --> 01:15:01,127
Do you have any marriage plans?

568
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:05,859
Uh, no...

569
01:15:06,103 --> 01:15:07,832
Well...

570
01:15:09,006 --> 01:15:11,941
...would you like
to marry my niece?

571
01:15:13,477 --> 01:15:14,409
I couldn't!

572
01:15:14,545 --> 01:15:18,845
At least hear us out.
We don't have any children.

573
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:22,116
She's like a daughter to us.

574
01:15:22,252 --> 01:15:26,120
And your mother was
a working girl here.

575
01:15:27,558 --> 01:15:30,425
You're like a son to us already.

576
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:33,761
If I do say so myself...

577
01:15:34,031 --> 01:15:36,591
...the girl's very pretty.

578
01:15:36,733 --> 01:15:39,395
And not from the Quarter, of course.

579
01:15:40,838 --> 01:15:43,932
In that case,
it is my filial duty to insist...

580
01:15:44,441 --> 01:15:48,639
...such a young lady should marry
a man of greater substance.

581
01:15:51,481 --> 01:15:55,417
I need someone to succeed me
in running this house.

582
01:15:55,552 --> 01:15:57,452
You know very well...

583
01:15:58,622 --> 01:16:00,954
...we can't just close it down.

584
01:16:31,989 --> 01:16:33,718
Tell me, Higurashi...

585
01:16:35,192 --> 01:16:37,990
...would you like to leave here?

586
01:16:39,229 --> 01:16:41,993
If it were on my own two feet...

587
01:16:43,634 --> 01:16:46,159
...I'd leave any time.

588
01:16:47,271 --> 01:16:50,832
I'll take you out of here.

589
01:16:53,277 --> 01:16:56,713
Whatever has come over you,
Milord Kuranosuke?

590
01:16:57,915 --> 01:17:00,543
Do you need someone to warm you?

591
01:17:00,684 --> 01:17:04,279
Don't make jokes. I mean it.

592
01:17:08,558 --> 01:17:13,257
You won't just be a concubine.

593
01:17:14,097 --> 01:17:16,463
I'll look after you, no matter what.

594
01:17:17,634 --> 01:17:23,072
If I ask formally,
will you accept me?

595
01:17:31,848 --> 01:17:33,907
When the cherry tree blooms.

596
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:37,717
The cherry tree?

597
01:17:39,289 --> 01:17:43,726
When cherry trees bloom
here in Yoshiwara...

598
01:17:46,763 --> 01:17:49,254
...I'll be ready to leave.

599
01:17:53,537 --> 01:17:55,402
Higurashi!

600
01:17:56,173 --> 01:17:57,731
Higurashi!

601
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:02,041
It's incredible!

602
01:18:02,179 --> 01:18:06,445
Lord Matsumoto's hired
the whole Quarter!

603
01:18:06,583 --> 01:18:07,982
And that's not all!

604
01:18:08,118 --> 01:18:11,610
He says he wants you to see
cherry blossoms!

605
01:18:11,755 --> 01:18:15,122
Come and look! Come on!

606
01:19:01,138 --> 01:19:03,368
Ah, that's good!

607
01:19:08,845 --> 01:19:12,178
Everyone! Listen to me!

608
01:19:14,551 --> 01:19:18,510
I wish to take
Higurashi of the Tamagikuya...

609
01:19:19,456 --> 01:19:21,390
...as my wife.

610
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:27,296
That is the reason for this banquet.
Drink your fill!

611
01:19:48,985 --> 01:19:50,885
Lord Matsumoto!

612
01:19:51,021 --> 01:19:52,852
Thank you, Milord!

613
01:19:52,989 --> 01:19:57,449
Lord Kuranosuke! Drink with us!

614
01:20:06,336 --> 01:20:08,031
That's wonderful!

615
01:21:09,799 --> 01:21:11,164
Higurashi...

616
01:21:12,202 --> 01:21:15,103
...you're not pregnant, are you?

617
01:21:16,773 --> 01:21:19,173
Why do you ask?

618
01:21:20,343 --> 01:21:22,174
What if I am?

619
01:21:27,884 --> 01:21:31,081
You'll have to get rid of it
with lantern-plant.

620
01:21:32,022 --> 01:21:33,614
It'll be rough.

621
01:21:34,157 --> 01:21:37,251
Take some time off.
The quicker you do it the better.

622
01:21:37,394 --> 01:21:39,453
Who says I'm going to?

623
01:21:41,097 --> 01:21:42,962
I've been blessed.

624
01:21:44,501 --> 01:21:47,470
Whoever's the father,
it's my child.

625
01:21:48,838 --> 01:21:50,567
I'm going to have it.

626
01:21:51,374 --> 01:21:54,366
What are you talking about?!

627
01:21:55,145 --> 01:21:58,012
Even if I didn't love
the father...

628
01:21:58,982 --> 01:22:01,416
...the child will always be mine.

629
01:22:03,286 --> 01:22:06,517
You can't refuse His Lordship now.
That's the rule!

630
01:22:06,656 --> 01:22:09,989
The boss'll force you
to get rid of the baby.

631
01:22:10,594 --> 01:22:14,030
I won't let him!
Tell His Lordship no.

632
01:22:14,297 --> 01:22:17,232
He's a samurai! He can kill you!

633
01:22:17,767 --> 01:22:20,099
If it means killing my own child...

634
01:22:20,437 --> 01:22:23,702
...then he can damn well
kill both of us!

635
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:28,336
Suit yourself.

636
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,714
Damn right I will!

637
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:47,997
Higurashi's so lucky!
Bought out of here by a lord!

638
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:49,257
Really!

639
01:22:49,399 --> 01:22:52,857
But can a whore
really be a samurai's wife?

640
01:22:53,003 --> 01:22:57,337
I'm sure Higurashi
will make him a fine wife.

641
01:22:57,474 --> 01:23:01,103
Anyway, that'll never happen
to any of us.

642
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:04,270
<i>I don't care who it is,
someone get me out of here!</i>

643
01:23:04,414 --> 01:23:06,541
Me, too!

644
01:23:06,783 --> 01:23:07,943
And me!

645
01:23:19,462 --> 01:23:22,920
What's the matter, Mr Seiji?

646
01:23:24,134 --> 01:23:25,396
Nothing.

647
01:23:39,949 --> 01:23:42,247
Have these.

648
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:49,952
Three of them? You don't mind?

649
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,068
Shigeji...

650
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:10,941
<i>...do you miss Takao-oiran?</i>

651
01:24:11,381 --> 01:24:15,841
<i>Higurashi-oiran
looks after me now.</i>

652
01:24:16,286 --> 01:24:20,120
The Missus says
to be grateful for that.

653
01:24:22,092 --> 01:24:23,286
I see...

654
01:24:24,427 --> 01:24:28,363
Who would you miss
if they died, Mr Seiji?

655
01:24:37,507 --> 01:24:39,702
Good question...

656
01:24:41,211 --> 01:24:42,940
I wonder who...

657
01:25:04,334 --> 01:25:05,824
I'm pregnant.

658
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:11,233
I don't know who the father is,
of course.

659
01:25:17,714 --> 01:25:20,877
But I mean to have the child.

660
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:26,555
I couldn't possibly go to you...

661
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:30,885
...pregnant with a child
whose father I don't know.

662
01:25:32,328 --> 01:25:35,354
Even less could I abort
the child...

663
01:25:40,103 --> 01:25:42,367
...to become your wife.

664
01:25:44,908 --> 01:25:46,773
Is this true?

665
01:26:08,731 --> 01:26:10,028
Higurashi...

666
01:26:11,801 --> 01:26:15,601
You are a fool, but so am I.

667
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:19,870
Would it trouble you if I said...

668
01:26:21,377 --> 01:26:23,140
...I'd still have you?

669
01:26:32,822 --> 01:26:34,483
Milord...

670
01:26:43,433 --> 01:26:44,832
Higurashi...

671
01:26:46,102 --> 01:26:48,161
Higurashi!

672
01:26:48,738 --> 01:26:49,762
What's wrong?

673
01:26:50,673 --> 01:26:51,571
Higurashi!

674
01:27:04,487 --> 01:27:08,514
I won't be needing
the lantern-plant.

675
01:27:13,062 --> 01:27:16,862
I keep telling myself
it can't be helped...

676
01:27:20,203 --> 01:27:22,535
But the poor baby...

677
01:27:29,812 --> 01:27:31,473
My mother...

678
01:27:32,749 --> 01:27:34,478
...was a whore.

679
01:27:37,153 --> 01:27:42,113
The child would be happy
knowing you wanted it.

680
01:27:59,509 --> 01:28:00,976
Get some rest.

681
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:22,052
Did you think
I was running away again?

682
01:29:24,527 --> 01:29:28,361
You never were
any good at it.

683
01:29:41,177 --> 01:29:44,669
It was here inside me...

684
01:29:45,648 --> 01:29:47,309
My baby!

685
01:30:58,354 --> 01:31:02,256
My Elder Sister is really something!

686
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:07,688
She's going to be
a samurai's wife!

687
01:31:13,269 --> 01:31:17,171
My name is Ume.
How do you do.

688
01:31:20,877 --> 01:31:24,335
My husband wants one blessing
to go with another.

689
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:29,508
He'd like Seiji and Ume's wedding
on the day you're redeemed.

690
01:31:29,986 --> 01:31:31,385
Would you mind?

691
01:32:32,248 --> 01:32:35,012
What are you looking at, Mr Seiji?

692
01:32:36,018 --> 01:32:37,076
Oh...

693
01:32:38,187 --> 01:32:41,714
...I was just thinking
it might rain tomorrow.

694
01:32:58,841 --> 01:33:02,368
It's been a long time, Kiyoha...

695
01:33:03,079 --> 01:33:07,709
No, you're 'Higurashi' now.

696
01:33:08,784 --> 01:33:13,881
I really wish people wouldn't
just suddenly...

697
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:16,581
...keep changing their names.

698
01:33:17,894 --> 01:33:20,226
I never know what to call anyone.

699
01:33:20,963 --> 01:33:25,332
When did this cicada
rise up out of the ground?

700
01:33:26,335 --> 01:33:27,962
What about you?

701
01:33:28,204 --> 01:33:30,502
We never saw you any more...

702
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:35,043
...after you wore yourself out
chasing your youth with a 'new girl'.

703
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:55,328
Do you remember...

704
01:33:56,532 --> 01:33:59,968
...that cherry tree
over at Inari Shrine?

705
01:34:00,903 --> 01:34:01,870
Yes.

706
01:34:02,838 --> 01:34:06,137
The only cherry tree in Yoshiwara.

707
01:34:06,542 --> 01:34:11,343
They say that ever since
you were an attendant...

708
01:34:11,714 --> 01:34:14,683
...you've been saying...

709
01:34:15,084 --> 01:34:20,078
...you'd leave here
when flowers grow on that tree.

710
01:34:21,958 --> 01:34:24,688
That was a little girl's dream.

711
01:34:25,461 --> 01:34:27,725
Why do you think that?

712
01:34:28,331 --> 01:34:32,893
I've given up hoping
that tree will ever flower.

713
01:34:33,669 --> 01:34:38,629
And so now it never will.

714
01:34:39,575 --> 01:34:44,603
Was it a good thing
to just abandon hope?

715
01:34:46,649 --> 01:34:49,709
If you don't give up hope...

716
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:53,313
...call the truth a lie...

717
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:57,018
...and a lie the truth...

718
01:34:58,494 --> 01:35:00,860
...you won't survive.

719
01:35:01,097 --> 01:35:03,088
Do you really...

720
01:35:03,866 --> 01:35:06,562
...believe that?

721
01:35:09,005 --> 01:35:11,064
Higurashi...

722
01:35:11,807 --> 01:35:17,609
...you don't understand a thing.

723
01:35:20,016 --> 01:35:23,144
There can't be a cherry tree...

724
01:35:25,421 --> 01:35:28,288
...that doesn't flower.

725
01:37:00,049 --> 01:37:03,212
It's like he's going home
after a night out.

726
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:08,547
Nobody knew the Yoshiwara Quarter
like he did.

727
01:37:09,892 --> 01:37:11,382
Thank you, sir!

728
01:37:11,527 --> 01:37:14,121
Thank you!

729
01:37:32,982 --> 01:37:35,314
Was someone teasing you?

730
01:37:36,919 --> 01:37:38,409
I was dreaming.

731
01:37:42,591 --> 01:37:44,525
A nightmare?

732
01:37:46,695 --> 01:37:50,096
I dreamed you'd gone far away
and died.

733
01:37:54,570 --> 01:37:56,094
I won't die.

734
01:37:57,573 --> 01:38:00,098
But thanks. Now go back to bed.

735
01:38:12,321 --> 01:38:14,016
Here, have this.

736
01:38:19,195 --> 01:38:21,322
It might not suit you, though.

737
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:23,427
Me more than you!

738
01:38:27,503 --> 01:38:30,700
Wear it after your first time.

739
01:38:33,175 --> 01:38:35,439
We have to be up early.

740
01:38:35,778 --> 01:38:40,374
lf you sleep in,
they'll burn moxa on you.

741
01:39:15,684 --> 01:39:17,151
Are you still up?

742
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:21,114
Oh, it's you...

743
01:39:25,995 --> 01:39:28,122
So tomorrow's my last day...

744
01:39:31,267 --> 01:39:34,862
When I first came here,
the place looked so big...

745
01:39:36,839 --> 01:39:38,807
Now it feels tiny.

746
01:39:47,916 --> 01:39:51,852
Well, with you gone...

747
01:39:55,357 --> 01:39:57,257
...it'll be quieter.

748
01:40:00,029 --> 01:40:02,497
Same to you!

749
01:40:08,904 --> 01:40:10,166
Higurashi...

750
01:40:27,156 --> 01:40:28,714
Be happy.

751
01:40:34,263 --> 01:40:35,594
You, too.

752
01:41:42,398 --> 01:41:45,196
Still no flowers, huh?

753
01:42:30,879 --> 01:42:32,403
A flower.

754
01:42:34,383 --> 01:42:35,907
Yep.

755
01:42:40,322 --> 01:42:45,089
Shall we go see
some real cherry blossoms?

756
01:42:49,898 --> 01:42:53,527
You won't have anything
if you go with me, though.

757
01:42:56,104 --> 01:43:00,302
That sounds like more fun
than having everything.

758
01:43:23,432 --> 01:43:27,095
That bastard! He'll pay for this!

759
01:43:29,104 --> 01:43:31,129
I'll kill him!

760
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:00,532
Fools, both of them!

761
01:44:03,372 --> 01:44:05,602
As I live and breathe!

762
01:44:19,588 --> 01:44:20,612
Hey!

763
01:44:34,169 --> 01:44:37,764
That's the only place
you can live, you know.

764
01:44:47,382 --> 01:44:49,714
<i>I wonder where Oiran is...</i>

765
01:44:58,660 --> 01:45:00,423
In the bath, maybe?

766
01:45:07,202 --> 01:45:09,363
One, two, three...

767
01:45:09,705 --> 01:45:12,299
Only three left?

768
01:45:12,641 --> 01:45:17,510
<i>Then I'll give one to Oiran,
and one to Mr Seiji.</i>
